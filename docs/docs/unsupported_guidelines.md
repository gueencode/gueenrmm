# Unsupported Guidelines

## General Information

Gueen RMM is designed to be secure by default.

You **CAN** **_expose_** it to the internet, and start deploying agents.

You **CAN** **_not expose_** it to the internet, and start deploying agents.

### Period

!!!info
        BIG PERIOD **.** <--- See, it's really really big ðŸ™‚

## That said

There are those that wish to add layers to their security onion. For the benefit of others following in their footsteps, we have added here for your convenience additional information on a range of subjects and technologies that have been graciously donated to us by the community at large.

Please be aware that those providing help and assistance in the Discord [#support](https://discord.com/channels/736478043522072608/744282073870630912) channel will generally assume that you are **not** one of these wizards of networking magic.

Should you employ any one or several of these unsupported technologies:

* Proxies
* Firewalls
* GeoIP filters
* fail2ban filters
* alternate methods of SSL cert management
* IDSs
* IPSs
* SDNs
* Did anything other than follow the installation instructions exactly
* and any/all other magical ABC thru XYZ technologies

Please let us know **BEFORE** we start troubleshooting and looking for software bugs that you are...in fact...a ðŸ§™...and using something non-standard ðŸ˜‰ 

These are "unsupported" because then we are troubleshooting **your** environment, not Gueen RMM. You need to have knowledge about how things work if you're going to stray from the [easy path](../install_server/#option-1-easy-install) of the standard install. 

Help us maximize keeping developer time and resources focused on new releases...not support goosechases.

Thank you and #KeepDeploying
