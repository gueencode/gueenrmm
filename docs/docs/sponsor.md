# Sponsor Gueen RMM

Gueen RMM is an MIT-licensed open-source project maintained by [@gueencode](https://github.com/gueencode), [@sadnub](https://github.com/sadnub) and a community of open source contributors. We work on behalf of the community to create new features, fix bugs, and maintain Gueen RMM.

Gueen RMM is currently the only open-source RMM available on the market. Responses from a recent survey have rated Gueen RMM as having the fastest and most reliable remote command and script execution compared to all other commercial RMM's. Sponsorships help keep this project alive and motivate the developers to continue to put in more time and effort into the advancement of Gueen RMM. Thousands of hours have been put in to developing, maintaining, improving, and supporting Gueen RMM. Your sponsorship would be greatly appreciated and helpful to keep this project going.

Funds donated will be used to setup a company to purchase a code signing certificate to sign all executables that are used by the RMM, costs needed to maintain demo and documentation sites, to support development of new features and the Linux and Mac agents.
