# Maintenance Mode

Enabling maintenance mode for an agent will prevent any overdue/check/task email/sms alerts from being sent.

It will also prevent clients/sites/agents from showing up as red in the dashboard if they have any failing checks or are overdue.

To enable maintenance mode for all agents in a client/site, **Right Click** on a client / site and choose **Enable Maintenance Mode**
