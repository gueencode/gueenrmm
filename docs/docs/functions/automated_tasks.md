# Automated Tasks

## Collector Tasks

Collector tasks allow saving data from script output directly to a custom field. The collector task will only save the last line of standard output of the script.

You can create collector tasks by adding it to an Automation Policy or adding it directly to an agent. During creation, select the **Collector** checkbox and select the custom field to save to. You can only save to agent custom fields at this time.

See [Custom Fields](custom_fields.md) and [Scripting](scripting.md) for more information
